## Git

The project follows a few common practices when working with git.
These are outlined in this section.

### Commits

Commit messages should summarize the work that was done in the commit, preferably in a single sentence.
When a commit is no longer than a single sentence, do not end the commit message with a period.
Commit messages should also be structured in the imperative form, to indicate what should happen to the repository when that commit is applied to it.

The following are some examples of well-structured commit messages:

- `Fix bug causing screen tearing in full-screen mode`
- `Change class name capitalization`
- `Refactor doStuff into separate doFoo and doBar functions`
