# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for considering contributing to the Nitrox Server Docker project! To ensure a smooth collaboration, please follow these guidelines when contributing to the project.

## Commit Messages

When making commits, please ensure that your commit messages are relevant, descriptive, and provide a clear explanation of the changes made. You can use single-line or multiline commit messages based on your preference. A good commit message helps other contributors and maintainers understand the purpose and context of the commit. Consider the following guidelines when writing commit messages:

- Start with a capitalized, short summary of the changes.
- Use the imperative mood ("Fix bug" instead of "Fixed bug").
- Keep the message clear, specific, and to the point.
- If necessary, provide additional details in the commit body.
- Reference any relevant issues or pull requests using the appropriate keywords (e.g., "Fixes #123").

Example single-line commit message:
- "Add Dockerfile for Nitrox server"
- "Fix volume mapping issue in Docker Compose file"
- "Update documentation regarding server configuration"

Example multiline commit message:
```
Refactor code for improved readability

- Extract common functions into separate modules
- Rename variables for better clarity
- Update comments for improved documentation

Fixes #123
```

Feel free to use multiline commit messages when necessary to provide more context and details about the changes made.

## Pull Request Guidelines

1. **Title**: Provide a clear and concise title for your pull request.
2. **Description**: Include a brief description of the changes made, explaining the purpose and context of the pull request.
3. **Testing**: If applicable, describe any testing you have performed to verify the changes. This may include steps to reproduce the issue or details about the test environment.
4. **Related Issues**: If your pull request addresses any existing issues or feature requests, reference them using the appropriate keywords (e.g., "Fixes #123").
5. **Commit Messages**: Ensure that your commit messages follow the guidelines mentioned above.

## Code Quality

Maintaining code quality is essential for the long-term success of any project. When contributing code, please keep the following principles in mind:

1. **Maintainability**: Write code that is easy to understand, modify, and maintain. Follow consistent coding conventions and use meaningful variable and function names.
2. **Readability**: Write code that is easy to read and comprehend. Use appropriate indentation, whitespace, and formatting to improve code readability.
3. **Documentation**: Document your code to provide clear explanations of its purpose, functionality, and usage. Use comments, docstrings, and inline documentation where appropriate.
4. **Modularity**: Encourage modular code design by breaking down complex functionality into smaller, reusable components. Aim for loose coupling and high cohesion.
5. **Testing**: Whenever possible, include tests to validate the correctness of your code changes. Write unit tests that cover critical functionality and edge cases.

By following these guidelines, you contribute to the project's overall code quality, maintainability, and collaboration experience.
